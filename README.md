# CyberCore Defective Robots Warehouse 2125

## Challenge Description

In 2125, the Earth is managed by CyberCore. Thousands of defective robots are stored in warehouses. Your task is to build a browser-based system that efficiently places these robots (as rectangles) in a 2D grid without overlap and minimal empty space.

### Challenge Goal

- Place all robots without overlaps
- Minimize unused grid space
- Load robot data from JSON input
- Display robot positions visually in a grid

---

## Input/Output

**Input:** 
- JSON array of robot objects: `{ id, width, height }`
- Loaded via textarea in UI
- Options for default or random data

**Output:** 
- Visual 2D grid showing robot placements
- List of robots with assigned coordinates
- System stats: placed robots, collisions, efficiency
- Collision detection and placement algorithm visualization

---

## Our Solution

### HTML (index.html)
Defines UI: header, warehouse grid (`.warehouse-grid`), JSON input, buttons (Load, Random, Optimize, Clear, Export), robot list, and system stats.

### CSS (style.css)
- Cyberpunk theme with glowing grids, neon gradients, and animations
- Styles for `.grid-cell`, `.occupied`, `.defective`, `.collision`
- Responsive layout and animations (e.g., pulsing defective cells)

### JavaScript (script.js)

#### Core Features

- Initializes 10x10 grid (modifiable)
- Supports loading robot JSON and random generation
- Adds `placed`, `defective`, and `position` fields to robot data
- Places robots with selected algorithm and updates grid

#### Key Functions

- `createWarehouseGrid()`: Builds grid DOM and internal array
- `loadRobotsFromJSON()`: Parses and validates input robots
- `generateRandomRobots()`: Creates random robots (3-10)
- `optimizePlacement()`: Applies selected placement algorithm
- `canPlaceRobot(robot, x, y)`: Validates robot placement
- `placeRobot(robot, x, y)`: Places robot and updates grid
- `detectCollisions()`: Flags any overlapping cells post-placement
- `updateDisplay()`: Updates grid cell visuals and robot list
- `updateSystemStats()`: Updates efficiency, placed, collision count

#### Algorithms Used

- **Best Fit**: Places robots in spot with least wasted surrounding space
- **First Fit**: Places robot at first available position (top-left scan)
- **Bottom-Left**: Places robots as low as possible, leftward within tie

## Statistics Displayed

- Total Robots
- Successfully Placed
- Efficiency (% of used cells)
- Collision Count (post-placement)
- Progress bars and robot list

---

## Extra Features & Creativity

- Cyberpunk UI: Neon glow, AI assistant, glitch animations
- Defective robots: 30% chance, pulsing animation
- Auto grid expansion (if overfilled)
- Export layout button (downloads JSON)
- AI tips via floating button
- Notifications with animations
